# Powerblock-Simulation

Step 1: Download all files into same folder

Step 2: Install iapws via iPython Console or command line <$ pip install iapws> 

Step 3: Run storage.py

Scenario 1: Runs the efficiency and Power output (MWe) given a reactor size and relates it to changing stored energy. 

Scenario 2: Runs through iterations of different outlet temperatures from the TES Storage. Plots Output Temp vs. Efficiency and Power Output.
